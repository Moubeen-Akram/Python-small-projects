A simple Graphical User Interface (GUI) Calculator built using Python (Tkinter).
It can perform basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
My first python project in which I learned about GUI, how to display screens and how calculator works.
Enjoyed doing it.

Features:
  Clean and simple interface
  Buttons for numbers (0–9) and operators (+, -, ×, ÷)
  Clear (C) button to reset the screen
  Equal (=) button to calculate the result
  Error handling for invalid operations (like divide by zero)

Used:
  Python 3
  Tkinter

Future Improvements:
  Add more advanced operations (square root, power, percentage).
  Improve UI design with themes/colors.
  Add keyboard input support.
